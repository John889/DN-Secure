#About Fapsecure
Fapsecure is an app that uses DNSCrypt to enforce a DNS server. It was made to help people with self-control. 
It uses cleanbrowsing Family by default and Neustar Family as a fall back resolver (IPv4)

A random password is generated automatically when fapsecure is run. It is saved in your C: drive in a file called fapsecurepw.txt

To stop fapsecure, run fapsecure-stop from the start menu and paste the password.
If you forgot the password, then you could enter 3 wrong passwords and a countdown timer of 4 hours would start. After 4 hours, fapsecure will be completely stopped.
