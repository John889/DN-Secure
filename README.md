DN-Secure helps with self control and cannot be stopped without its password or you will have to wait for a delay of 4 hours (the delay could be modified).

When you enable DN-Secure it will generate a file called DN-Securepw.txt in your C: drive. It contains the password to remove DN-Secure.
Copy that password and paste it on lockbox.pluckeye.net by creating a new box. Don't forget to change the delay to a few hours (or more).
Once you're sure that everything is working fine delete the password from the file DN-Securepw.txt.
To disable DN-Secure, open DN-Secure from the start menu, and paste the password using the right mouse click OR ctrl+v THEN press enter.

*To change DN-Secure settings, open DN-Secure Settings from the start menu, then open HowToUse.txt which contains more instructions.

*It uses DNSCrypt and Cleanbrowsing Family DNS (A filtering DNS) is enforced by default. More info here: https://cleanbrowsing.org/filters
*You can change the DNS server to anything else that you prefer by opening DN-Secure settings from the start menu.
It will open a folder conaining many files. Open HowToUse.txt for detailed instructions. 

*You can't change the DNS server once DN-Secure is enabled. You need to disable DN-Secure first which needs the password, then re-enable DN-Secure.

*Cleanbrowsing Family DNS (IPv4 & IPv6) is used as a fall back resolver if DNSCrypt fails.

DNS changes will affect:
*All of your interfaces interfaces (Wifi and Ethernet).
*Both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.

It won't affect other devices on your home network.
